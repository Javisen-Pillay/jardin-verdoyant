          Jardin Verdoyant was founded in 1990 with a mission to bring beautiful, sustainable landscapes to our community. 
          Over the past three decades, we have grown from a small local business to a leading landscape design and construction company 
          in the Ottawa area. Our team of experienced horticulturists, designers, and builders are dedicated to creating outdoor spaces 
          that not only look stunning but also enhance the natural environment. We pride ourselves on our attention to detail, 
          commitment to quality, and passion for sustainable gardening practices.
