          <h3>Step 1: Planning Your Garden</h3>
          <p>Begin by planning your garden layout. Consider the size of your space, the type of soil, and the amount of sunlight your garden will receive. Sketch out a plan on paper, marking areas for different plants, paths, and features.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Step 2: Preparing the Soil</h3>
          <p>Good soil preparation is crucial for a healthy garden. Remove any weeds and debris from the area. Test the soil pH and amend it as necessary. Add compost or organic matter to enrich the soil and improve drainage.</p>
        </li>

          <h3>Step 3: Selecting Plants</h3>
          <p>Choose plants that are well-suited to your climate and soil conditions. Consider the mature size of the plants and how they will fit into your garden plan. Group plants with similar water and sunlight needs together.</p>

          <h3>Step 4: Planting</h3>
          <p>Follow the planting instructions for each type of plant. Dig holes that are appropriate for the size of the plant's root ball. Place the plants in the holes and fill them with soil, gently firming it around the roots. Water the plants thoroughly after planting.</p>
        </li>

          <h3>Step 5: Maintenance</h3>
          <p>Regular maintenance is essential for a thriving garden. Water your plants as needed, mulch to conserve moisture and suppress weeds, and fertilize according to the needs of your plants. Prune and deadhead plants to encourage healthy growth and remove any diseased or damaged parts.</p>
